# Mamaearth_Wellness_End_to_End_Ecommerce_Analytics_(Flipkart)
## 🎯 Project Summary
In the highly competitive digital personal care market, data is the bridge between product quality and consumer trust. This project delivers a 360-degree strategic evaluation of Mamaearth’s wellness portfolio on Flipkart. By integrating automated data extraction with multi-stage analytical processing, this study deciphers the "North Star" metrics behind brand success: the intersection of aggressive pricing, consumer sentiment (600k+ reviews), and the 'Flipkart Assured' trust factor. The resulting intelligence identifies high-margin "Hero" products and provides a roadmap for optimizing underperforming stock.
